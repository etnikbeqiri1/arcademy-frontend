# Arcademy - Online Game-based Learning Platform

The development of this platform will make learning as participatory and simple as feasible. The teacher can see the students' concentration during the lecture by using this platform in the session.
Although there are platforms that provide learning through various games, such a platform does not exist in Albanian. There will be literature on numerous injuries in Albanian on our portal. It is estimated that using it will boost contact between lecturers and students by 35%, because the lecturer will understand where the platform is, what may have more, and what implies topic.

Because mini-quizzes may be held electronically without the need for sheets, the platform will be for schools, faculties, and courses to save on sheets and printing.

The technology would save professors time because the platform would calculate student points automatically.
